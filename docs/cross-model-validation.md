# Cross-Model Validation Results

TurboQuant quick bench across multiple model families, architectures, and sizes.
Hardware: Apple M5 Max 128GB. All tests with sparse V enabled.

## Why Cross-Model Testing Matters

This testing methodology caught a critical ISWA bug that single-model testing on Qwen would never have found. Gemma 2 (which uses interleaved sliding window attention) had PPL 13.7 trillion — complete garbage output at normal inference speed. The bug was a missing WHT rotation in one of five `build_attn` overloads in `llama-graph.cpp`. Without testing diverse model architectures, this would have shipped broken to every ISWA model user (Gemma 2, Cohere2, OLMo2, Gemma3N).

**Lesson:** Always test across model families, not just the model you developed on.

**Key findings:**
- All hd128 models work across 4 families (Qwen, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Mistral)
- turbo4 consistently closer to q8_0 than turbo3
- Gemma 2 (ISWA) **FIXED** — was missing WHT rotation in ISWA build_attn overload (PPL 13.7T → 3.80)
- Llama 70B shows higher PPL gap (+8.3%) — likely Q4_K_M weight quant stacking with KV quant

## Results

### Model 1: Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Q8_0 (MoE, reference)

Already validated extensively. See README and turbo4-resurrection.md.

| Cache | PPL | Decode tok/s | vs q8_0 |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------|
| q8_0 | 6.1109 | 85.71 | — |
| turbo4 | 6.1250 | 79.87 | 0.93x |
| turbo3 | 6.1756 | 76.84 | 0.90x |

### Model 2: Qwen3.5-27B Q8_0 (Dense)

| Cache | PPL | Decode tok/s | vs q8_0 |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------|
| q8_0 | 6.8884 | 17.17 | — |
| turbo4 | 6.9378 | 17.25 | 1.00x |

### Model 3: Mixtral 8x7B Instruct Q4_K_M (MoE)

⚠️ **GGUF incompatible** — `second-state` repo uses old format, missing `ffn_down_exps` tensor. Need bartowski or official Mixtral GGUF. Skipped.

### Model 4: Gemma 2 27B IT Q4_K_M (Dense, ISWA)

✅ **FIXED** — was PPL 13.7 trillion, now 3.80.

**Root cause:** The ISWA (interleaved sliding window attention) `build_attn` overload was missing turbo WHT Q rotation and V inverse rotation. K/V were rotated in SET_ROWS but Q was unrotated → `rotated_K × unrotated_Q = garbage`. One fix in `llama-graph.cpp`.

**Note:** Gemma 2 K/V head_dim IS 128 (not 256 as initially assumed — GGUF metadata confirms `key_length=128`).

| Cache | PPL | vs q8_0 | Decode tok/s | NIAH |
|-------|-----|---------|-------------|------|
| q8_0 | 3.7504 | — | 28.44 | 3/3 |
| turbo4 | 3.7852 | +0.9% | 26.12 | — |
| turbo3 | 3.7957 | +1.2% | 25.36 | — |

This fix also applies to any other ISWA model (Cohere2, OLMo2, Gemma3N).

### Model 5: Phi-4 Q8_0 (Dense)

| Cache | PPL | Decode tok/s | NIAH |
|-------|-----|-------------|------|
| q8_0 | 6.0014 | 33.66 | 3/3 |
| turbo3 | 6.2336 (+3.9%) | 29.82 | 3/3 |
| turbo4 | 6.1024 (+1.7%) | 30.54 | 3/3 |

turbo4 quality advantage holds on Phi-4. +1.7% vs q8_0.

### Model 6: Llama 3.1 70B Instruct Q4_K_M (Dense, large)

| Cache | PPL | vs q8_0 | Decode tok/s | NIAH |
|-------|-----|---------|-------------|------|
| q8_0 | 2.4397 | — | 11.50 | 3/3 |
| turbo4 | 2.6431 | +8.3% | 10.78 | 3/3 |
| turbo3 | 2.7878 | +14.3% | 10.68 | 3/3 |

Larger PPL gap than smaller models. Likely due to Q4_K_M weight quantization stacking with KV quantization — the model weights are already quantized, adding KV quantization compounds the error. turbo4 still significantly better than turbo3.

### Model 7: Mistral Small 24B Q4_K_M (Dense)

| Cache | PPL | Decode tok/s | NIAH |
|-------|-----|-------------|------|
| q8_0 | 6.0946 | 34.52 | 3/3 |
| turbo3 | 6.2792 (+3.0%) | 28.73 | 3/3 |
| turbo4 | 6.1224 (+0.46%) | 29.54 | 3/3 |

Excellent results — turbo4 within 0.5% of q8_0 on Mistral.
